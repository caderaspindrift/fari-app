# Countdown to Crisis {#toc-crisis-countdown }

<page-meta author="Cadera Spindrift" description="Cosmic Legends of the Universe: Countdown to Crisis" />

A Crisis can begin when one or more heroes hear of an ongoing problem
and rush to the scene, or a problem could spontaneously arise at a
location where some heroes happen to be present. Not all heroes need 
to present at the start of a Crisis.

The steps to take before a Crisis are:

5. Set the Scene
4. Hero Roll-Call
3. Define the Goals
2. Assemble the Teamwork Pool
1. The Crisis begins!

## Setting the Scene {#toc-crisis-scene}

[]{.lorem}

For example, []{.lorem}

### Scene Power Words

[]{.lorem}

For example, []{.lorem}

## Hero Roll-Call {#toc-crisis-present}

[]{.lorem}

For example, []{.lorem}

## Defining the Goals {#toc-crisis-goals}

[]{.lorem}

- **Smash**  - defeating the Crisis through physical damage
- **Outwit** - trick, persuade, or control the source of the Crisis
- **Allay**  - understand and resolve the source of the Crisis
- **Rescue** - save people or property endangered by the Crisis

For example, []{.lorem}

## Teamwork Pool -- Assemble! {#toc-crisis-pool}

When the Crisis starts, every player makes a roll to build the 
initial Teamwork Pool. The Teamwork Pool is an abstract way of 
describing the factors that give the heroes the upper hand in resolving
a Crisis. 

If your hero is present at the scene of a Crisis, describe how your hero
reacts when they become aware of the Crisis, and then make a roll using
an Approach related to that reaction. Add the Effectiveness of that roll to
the Teamwork Pool, along with the successes the other players roll for
their heroes.

If your hero is *not* on the Scene, add 1 to the Teamwork Pool when it's
being formed. During the Hero Phase of the Crisis, the heroes can spend
from the Teamwork Pool to call in the remaining heroes.

For example, []{.lorem}

# Starting a Crisis {#toc-crisis-start}

Once the Teamwork Pool is formed, itâ€™s time to start dealing with the Crisis.

Instead of having an initiative order like many tabletop roleplaying games,
there are two phases during a Crisis that alternate back and forth: 
the Hero Phase and the Crisis Phase. 

The first thing that happens after the Teamwork Pool is formed is 
the Hero Phase.
