# Ideals {#toc-ideals}

<page-meta author="Cadera Spindrift" title="Cosmic Legends of the Universe: Ideals" description="Ideals drive your hero to perform feats of heroic courage."/>
Your hero has five Ideals that drive them to feats of 
heroic courage. These are single words that can be freely chosen
by you when you create your hero; there's no set list.

For example, one hero could have these five Ideals:

:::::::: {.chargen-list .twocolumn } ::::::::::
- **Truth**
- **Justice**
- **Responsibility**
- **Restraint**
- **Hope**
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

[]{.lorem}

When you use all five of your hero's Ideals in a Storyline, 
your hero's Might is refreshed to its starting value, and you
unlock your Nova Power Words. You can use those Nova Power Words
until the end of current Storyline.

When a new Storyline begins, all the marked off Ideals are 
cleared and itâ€™s time to start again.

## Random Ideals

If you're stuck for ideas, you can roll roll two dice and 
check the following table -- or just pick up to five from 
the list that sound good.
